# Basic

This document mainly describes the basic operations of the application.

## Main Menu

When the application starts, it will create a tray icon in the system tray. After launching the software, the application's icon will be displayed in the taskbar tray. If you do not see this icon, please click the expand button on the left side of the tray to expand the tray menu and consider pinning the application's icon to the taskbar.

Clicking this icon will open the application's main menu. All functions of the software need to be accessed from here. You can right-click the tray icon to open the main menu and access various functions of the application.

## Main Interface

The application will create a window with a semi-transparent background on the desktop, docked at the top center of the screen by default. This window will display the enabled schedule and mark the current time point.

When the mouse moves to the top of the main interface, the main interface will automatically reduce its opacity to ensure it does not block the content behind the window. Mouse clicks can penetrate the window to operate the content behind it.

The main interface of the software will be displayed at the top of the screen by default, showing the schedule, reminders, and other information. When a course is in session, the corresponding course will expand and display a progress bar below.

In [【Application Settings】→【Window】](classisland://app/settings/window), you can adjust the docking position and window level of the main interface.

In [【Application Settings】→【Appearance】](classisland://app/settings/appearance), you can adjust the scaling size and background opacity of the main interface.

You can customize the information displayed on the main interface through the [【Components】](classisland://app/settings/components) feature.

The main interface displays the 【Date】 and 【Schedule】 components by default. You can add and remove components as needed.

To add a component, drag it from the component library to the component bar. Dragging components on the component bar can adjust the display order of the components. After selecting a component on the component bar, if the component has settings options, the component settings will automatically be displayed. Component settings are independent of each other.
